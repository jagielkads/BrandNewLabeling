#Briefing
This bunch of code is my implementation of two state-of-the-art 2-hop labeling techniques for all pairs shortest path indexing, PLL and HopDoubling. Details can be found in their papers[1][2]. Also thanks to the two major authors for their codes and slides[3][4][5] which help me great a lot to understand these techniques.

For any one who is interested in this topic of research, I have shared a SODA'02 paper[6] which proposes several theoretical properties of 2-hop indexing.
